# Disaster-Prep

Our team selected the “Don’t Forget the Can Opener!” Challenge because it reflects our values as Girl Scouts and reflects our skill set. Below is a list of team members and some relevant information:


Madeline Vagnuolo - Lead coder, 10th grade
Halli Morrison - Coder, artist, designer, content contributor  10th grade
Katie Runyans - Coder, writer, designer, 10th grade
Karris Morrison - Editor, chief audio and visuals, 8th grade
Allie Polzin - Main website designer, 8th grade
Ella Duus - website designer, content researcher,writer, narrator, presenter, 8th grade
        
        Our solution to this problem is a website where the main features are a personalized checklist for both supplies and instructions, text alerts when you’re at risk for a natural disasters, and information straight from NASA. Our project is a website/app because almost anyone can use them nowadays. It’s the easiest, quickest solution, especially as our challenge would be used in an emergency. You can also use the offline version if a natural disaster has left you without internet connection. 


We planned to use this NASA data set (https://data.nasa.gov/Earth-Science/NASA-Disasters-Mapping-Portal/vyzu-gm3d)         ` in our text alert reminders as it was a provided source, but there is nothing in the data set. Many of the links were nonfunctional.


        This Weebly page we created represents a mockup of our code: https://disaster-prep.weebly.com/
The Weebly is an idea of what where we would want to take the website in the future. Our prototype app code is in Python because it is a simple, easy to use programming language. We would also want to add code for even more natural disaster types, such as blizzards, hurricanes, and storms.
        
        Our team was very satisfied with our end product, and it met our goal for a functional, easy to use solution to this challenge. We faced many obstacles, some of which were recording good audio and figuring out difficult parts of code, but we persevered and it paid off. We were all most happy at the high quality of teamwork and camaraderie that our team had. As the Girl Scout Law states,
“I will do my best to be
    honest and fair,
    friendly and helpful,
    considerate and caring, 
    courageous and strong, and
    responsible for what I say and do,  
    And to respect myself and others, 
    respect authority,
    use resources wisely,
    make the world a better place, and 
    be a sister to every Girl Scout.”
